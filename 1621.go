// Given n points on a 1-D plane, where the ith point (from 0 to n-1) is at x = i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The k line segments do not have to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.

// Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7

// Input: n = 4, k = 2
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The two line segments are shown in red and blue.
// The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)}, {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.
